#FINAL PROJECT!!!!!!
#So Travel plan- need to access some ticket service thing/place and get all their data
#https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/ is the easy option
        #Do this last first build the program around fake data so I don't have to pay .35c after 50 queries
        # jake in charge of making fake program- do like 5 places and prices between
# they should be able to imput a starting airport or city and an end city/airport 
#as well as the airline they want to take (they can choose a don't care btw)
#we need to organize the data according to price
#All the information will be displayed in order of least expensive up -10 options should be enough
# should be able to click on a price and buy a ticket
